      <h2>Academic Program</h2>
      <p>
        At TMU, I am pursuing a degree in Business Technology Management (BTM)
        with a minor in Computer Science. My coursework combines the worlds of
        business and technology, and I have a deep interest in Artificial
        Intelligence and its real-world applications. My minor in Computer
        Science has allowed me to explore machine learning, large language
        models (LLMs), and API integration in various projects.
      </p>

      <h2>Most Useful Course</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Course:</strong> Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (CPS
        721)
      </p>
      <p>
        This course has been instrumental in shaping my interest in AI. It gave
        me the foundational understanding of algorithms, neural networks, and
        large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, which I now use in various
        projects. Learning how to apply machine learning to real-world problems
        has been the highlight of my studies.
